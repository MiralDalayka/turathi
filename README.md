## **Overview**
Many travelers, both local and international, often overlook lesser-known places in Jordanian cities because there isn't enough easy-to-find information about them. The main issue is that people who want to explore face a problem dealing with a confusing mix of information from different sources. This complicated situation not only makes people less interested in exploring but also takes up a lot of their time that could be better used for enjoying the experience. It also means that hidden places don't get as much attention, which affects local communities economically and culturally. It's like solving a tricky puzzle with pieces scattered everywhere.

We want to make it simple for everyone to discover and learn about historical places in Jordan without having to search all over the place, in a way that's easy to understand to avoid making them feel confused, lost, and stressed. We aim to bring attention to lesser-known historical places that are unnoticed or not well-known to the public. Our app isn't just an information hub â€“ it's a way to connect, explore, and make the most of the incredible places and experiences Jordan has to offer! We believe this will make tourism in Jordan more vibrant, sustainable, and exciting.
